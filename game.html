    <div style="color:0000dd; width:540px; font-family:arial">Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), also known as action real-time strategy (ARTS), is a subgenre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of real-time strategy in which each player controls a single character, usually on a map in an isometric perspective, as part of a team competing against another team of players. The ultimate objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of periodically-spawned computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths; However, MOBA games can have other victory conditions, such as defeating every player on the enemy team. Player characters typically have set of unique abilities that improve over the course of a game and which contribute to a team's overall strategy. Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of real-time strategy, role-playing, and action games.</div>
